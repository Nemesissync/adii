            <span>I cannot find the right words to explain the
                pain I caused you. I am truly sorry for my thoughtless words/actions that hurt you deeply. My actions were
                insensitive, and I can imagine how they made you feel. I want you to know that hurting you was never my intention,
                and I am devastated to see the pain in your eyes. I am ready to do whatever it takes to make amends and rebuild your
                trust in me. I promise to learn from my mistakes, to be more considerate of your feelings, and to cherish what we have.
                I understand. Please find it in your heart to forgive me. I love you more than anything else in this world, and I am
                willing to work tirelessly to mend what I have broken. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I want to be the
                one who gives it to you. I understand if you need time and space. I will respect your decision, no matter what it may
                be. But please know that I am here, waiting and hoping for a chance to make things right. Once again, I am truly sorry
                for my actions. I promise to be a better person, not just for you, but for myself too. I love you with all my heart, and
                I am willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy again. I love you so much adi! ❤️
